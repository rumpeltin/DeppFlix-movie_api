DeppFlix

This project will be a REST API for an application called “DeppFlix” that interacts with a database that stores data about different movies. It will be build to get familiar with Node.js and, overall, server-side programming.

Users will be able to...

1. access to information about different movies, directors & genres
2. sign up, update their personal information & create a list of their favorite movies
